# Git Snippets: Create Repo, Clone, and Status

These are the first Git commands youâ€™ll need when starting with a project.  

---

## 1. Create a New Repository (Local)

If youâ€™re starting a brand-new project:  

  ```bash
  git init
  ```

- Creates a hidden `.git` folder inside your project.
-This is what makes Git start tracking your files.

âœ… Run this **only once per project**.

---

## 2. Clone an Existing Repository (From GitHub)

If you want to copy a project from GitHub to your computer:

  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```

Example:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git
  ```

- Creates a new folder named after the repo.
- Contains the project files + Git history.

âœ… Use this when you **join a project** or want to **practice with a sample repo**.

---

## 3. Check Repository Status

To see whatâ€™s happening inside your repo:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

It shows:

- âœ… Which branch youâ€™re on
- âœ… Which files have changes
- âœ… Which files are staged (ready to commit)
- âœ… Which files are not tracked yet

Example output:

  ```bash
  On branch main
  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
  
  Changes not staged for commit:
    modified: index.html
  ```
